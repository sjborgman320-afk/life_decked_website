    <h1>Welcome to Life Decked</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Life Decked 

Where careers, choices, and chaos collide — one card at a time. 

In this game, life itself has been reimagined as a strategic card battle. Build your deck, play your hand, and outmaneuver your opponent as you navigate the unpredictable balance of work, people, and projects. Whether you're climbing the corporate ladder or just trying to keep your HQ afloat, every card counts. 

Choose up to two colors to define your moral path and project strengths. Will you pursue positive earnings, embrace a chaotic workplace, or aim for moral clarity? Every decision shapes your deck — and your destiny. 

From employees and titles to tools, services, products, and locations, every card you play pushes your project closer to success... or disaster. Revenue drives your actions, but how you spend it determines the outcome. Use action cards wisely, equip your team with traits and tools, and don’t forget to tally your project points — that’s how you win. 

It's not just about business — it's about surviving the grind with strategy and a little bit of luck. 

So shuffle up, draw your hand, and get ready to turn life into your greatest project. </p>
